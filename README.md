## Technologies and Architecture

The app is built using the latest technologies and adheres to a modern architecture:

- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for user management, registration, authentication, and message storage. Its cloud-based solution ensures reliable performance and data security.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The app follows the MVVM design pattern, separating data handling, view rendering, and business logic for maintainable and testable code.

- **CocoaPods**: CocoaPods is utilized for dependency management, making it easy to integrate Firebase SDK and other necessary libraries.

- **UIKit and Autolayout**: UIKit is the foundation of the app's UI, while Autolayout ensures an adaptive design that scales across different devices.
